# Example .tfc format:
# 
#   Tags:
#   (Note: There must be whitespace of some sort between the tag and 
#   parameters (with the exception of the comment tag, #)
#
#   	#  - Indicates comment.  Any text following a # on the beginning 
#            of a line will be ignored.
#   	.v - Variable list.  All variables (in AND out) need to be listed 
#            here, seperated by commas.  Any whitespace following the 
#            beginning of this list will be considered as a part of the 
#            variable name.
#   	.i - List of variables used as input (remaining variables from .v 
#            list are constant).  .v must have been previously defined.
#   	.o - List of variables used as output (remaining variables from .v 
#            list are garbage).  .v must have been previously defined.
#   	.c - Values for constant input variables.  .v and .i must have been 
#            previously defined.
#
#   Once the four main tags have been defined, a line containing the text: 
#   "BEGIN" (without quotes, any case) signifies the beginning of the gate 
#   listing.
#
#   Gates:
#   
#   	Gates should be written on a single line.  Gates will continue to 
#       be read until a line is reached that is not a proper gate, or end 
#       of file.
#   	
#	Format = Gx : 	G = 'T' or 'F' (lowercase acceptable) meaning 
#                           Toffoli or Fredkin gate
#                 	x = Number of parameters
#   	
#	Parameters follow on the same line and, similar to the parameters 
#       for the tags above, are seperated from the gate type by whitespace.  
#       Each parameter should be found in the .v list defined above, and 
#       should be seperated by commas.
#
#   END statement terminates the input.

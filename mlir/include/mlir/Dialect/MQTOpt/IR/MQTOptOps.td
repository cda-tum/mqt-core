    let summary = "The MQT optimization (mqtopt) dialect.";

    let description = [{
        This dialect is using value semantics for qubits. This means that
        variables of type qubit and the elements of qubit registers do not
        identify a physical, they rather refer to the state of a qubit. A qubit
        state can be assigned only once and can also be used only once.
        Otherwise, the no-cloning theorem would be violated.

        The first requirement is enforced by the SSA form of MLIR. The second
        requirement is not explicitly enforced. However, when converting the
        input dialect mqt that is using reference semantics to the mqtopt dialect,
        qubit state values will only be used once by construction. This is also
        the reason why the mqtopt dialect is not meant to be used by hand, but
        rather as an intermediate representation for optimization passes.

        Due to the value semantics, the mqtopt dialect allows dataflow analysis
        and optimizations. Those are very common in classical compiler
        optimizations. Hence, the existing classical compiler optimizations can
        easier be reused for quantum programs.

        For more information, see the paper "QIRO:A Static Single Assignment
        based Quantum Program Representation for Optimization"

 * @brief A memory manager for objects of the same type that inherit from
 * `LLBase`.
 * @details The class manages a collection of objects. The objects are
 * stored in contiguous chunks of memory. The manager supports reclaiming
 * objects that are no longer in use. This is done by maintaining a linked list
 * of available objects. When an object is no longer in use, it is added to the
 * list. When a new object is requested, the first object from the list is
 * returned. If the list is empty, an object from the current chunk is returned.
 * If the current chunk is full, a new chunk is allocated. The size of chunks
 * grows exponentially according to a growth factor.
 * @note The main purpose of this class is to reduce the number of memory
 * allocations and deallocations. This is achieved by allocating a large number
 * of objects at once and reusing them. This is especially useful for objects
 * that are frequently created and destroyed, such as decision diagram nodes,
 * edge weights, etc.

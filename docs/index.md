# MQT Core - The Backbone of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)

```{raw} latex
\begin{abstract}
```

MQT Core is an open-source C++17 and Python library for quantum computing that forms the backbone of the quantum software tools developed as part of the _{doc}`Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) <mqt:index>`_ [^1].
To this end, MQT Core consists of multiple components that are used throughout the MQT, including a fully fledged intermediate representation (IR) for quantum computations, a state-of-the-art decision diagram (DD) package for quantum computing, and a state-of-the-art ZX-diagram package for working with the ZX-calculus.
This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the MQT Core library, including {doc}`installation instructions <installation>`, a {doc}`quickstart guide for the MQT Core IR <mqt_core_ir>`, and detailed {doc}`API documentation <api/mqt/core/index>`.
The source code of MQT Core is publicly available on GitHub at [munich-quantum-toolkit/core](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core), while pre-built binaries are available via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.core/) for all major operating systems and all modern Python versions.
MQT Core is fully compatible with Qiskit 1.0 and above.

[^1]:
    The _[Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)](https://mqt.readthedocs.io)_ is a collection of software tools for quantum computing developed by the [Chair for Design Automation](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) as well as the [Munich Quantum Software Company (MQSC)](https://munichquantum.software).
    Among others, it is part of the [Munich Quantum Software Stack (MQSS)](https://www.munich-quantum-valley.de/research/research-areas/mqss) ecosystem, which is being developed as part of the [Munich Quantum Valley (MQV)](https://www.munich-quantum-valley.de) initiative.
